title: Public Speaking
---
I was never afraid of public speaking until I was required to take a course on it. Once my professor called attention to all of the things I'd never thought about, such as tripping on stage, forgetting my notes, or pissing myself, I began to get VERY self-conscious about speaking. In fact, it became so bad that I started bombing class presentations. My normal B average dropped to a C, and with it, my desire to even go to class anymore.

And then I got a job that forced me to be in front of people. I wasn't always talking to them from a podium, 

Eventually I got over my fear.




Public speaking is now an important part of my job. I get PAID to make words at people, and I'd better not fuck it up. Not just because work would be angry, but it'd be disrespectful to the people attending for me to bomb a talk they thought they could learn from.





I often tell people what I do, and I'm met with a variety of faces ranging from "why do you hate yourself" to "I'm not even speaking and I'm about to puke." People simply don't like it. The insteresting thing about their reactions is that most of them have never actually done real public speaking. Most of them got their first taste of it in a classroom.

I'm here to tell you that the real deal is SO much better than a classroom simulation.








Since I have, I figured I could shed some light on what it feels like, how you can do it with some level of professionalism, and how you can prevent yourself from shitting your pants on stage.


The most important part about not shitting your pants is twofold:

- Prepare. Prepare until you don't give a single fuck about the words you're making, and then prepare some more. Prepare until you have DREAMS about the words you're going to make at people. Until you dream about missing VGA cables and bent HDMI outputs, you're not prepared enough.
- Then, don't eat before your talk. 


That's all. It really is that easy.

Just kidding. 






Once you're at the venue, go to any rooms you'll be speaking in.




When you're just starting out, try to limit yourself to one talk per event. You can do more, but each talk you add takes time away from time you could be spending with people at the conference.
