People give PHP a lot of shit. People give PHPeople even more shit for choosing to use PHP and liking every minute of it, as if people who enjoy PHP really have some Stockholm Syndrome going on. Regardless of what your stance on this is, there's no way in hell I'd ever stop using it.

"But Amanda! PHP doesn't have $x and encourages the $y anti-pattern!" Okay
