I've always been a musician.

The first time I picked up an instrument with the intention of playing it was in 3rd grade. My school's music program allowed us to pick from several instruments and I chose the saxophone. They herded us into a room to make sure our hands were big enough to hold our instrument of choice. 


The rest was history. Since then I've picked up piano, flute, trumpet, violin, guitar, and some percussion. I eventually got my saxophone too.
