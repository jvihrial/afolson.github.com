I was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid. I don't remember exactly what age I was, but my parents and teachers noticed a problem -- I wasn't doing well in school despite testing off the charts for reading and writing ability.

As an adult things have been a little different. I don't fidget in my chair as much, I have a modicum of responsibility, and in general I carry on well enough. However, imagine that there are 60 TV screens blaring in a room, each with a different show on.
