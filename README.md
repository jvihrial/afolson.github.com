# Blaggin'

In case it wasn't obvious, this is the source for my blog. I'm using Jekyll to create the content and GitHub pages to host it because I'm lazy^Wcheap. But also, it's just a really nice combination.

## Checking Stuff Out

1. Clone it
2. `cd` into it
3. `jekyll serve --watch`
4. Behold it on `http://127.0.0.1:4000`
