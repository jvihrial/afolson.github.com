I guess this is where I write about myself. Here are some things you should know about me:

I'm Amanda, a 20-something human that fits somewhere between software developer, marketer, and recruiter. If you were to draw a Venn diagram of my career it would look like some sort of crazy bubble wrap.

I have a BS in Software Design, and an MS in Forensic Studies (computer forensics). I got both when I was 21.

I like to write for people and computers. I speak English, some German, PHP, Perl, C#, and a little bit of C/C++. I want to learn Chinese and Python a bit better.

I've been all over the world and love to travel.

I own a sweet at life moped. ~~One day I'll own a motorcycle, but I will totally ride the moped to work anyway because it's that legit.~~ I now own a 2011 BMW F650GS. Every now and then I park it in the living room next to the moped and the cats sleep on it since they think it's theirs.

I really like horses, and I used to go horseback riding a lot.

I don't like seafood (but I used to!). Sushi and clam chowder are among the things I used to eat that I now won't touch. However, I love hibachi when chicken or cows are involved.

I play guitar and sing, but only for myself. I'd like to be a musician and play for a crowd of millions, but for now I'm content to make noise in the privacy of my apartment.

Every now and then I enjoy a cigar.

I don't talk much, but if you ask me questions I'll usually answer.

I like cats. I am currently owned by two cats.

I let my mind wander when my feet can't. It gets me in trouble.

When I was younger (3 or so) I got dared to lick a mushroom. I got violently ill and won't eat them to this day.

I've done a barrel roll in a Super Hornet.

I enjoy model cars. My favorite is a red 1995 Camaro. Just kidding there's no way I can have a favorite that's like asking what my favorite food is.
