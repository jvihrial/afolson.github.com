### General

I guess this is where I write about myself. Here are some things you should know about me:

 - I'm Amanda, a 20-something human that fits somewhere between software developer, marketer, and recruiter. If you were to draw a Venn diagram of my career it would look like some sort of crazy bubble wrap.
 - I have a BS in Software Design, and an MS in Forensic Studies (computer forensics). I got both when I was 21.
 - I like to write for people and computers. I speak English, some German, PHP, Perl, C#, and a little bit of C/C++. I want to learn Chinese and Python a bit better.
 - I've been all over the world and love to travel.
 - I own a sweet at life moped. ~~One day I'll own a motorcycle, but I will totally ride the moped to work anyway because it's that legit.~~ I now own a 2011 BMW F650GS. Every now and then I park it in the living room next to the moped and the cats sleep on it since they think it's theirs.
 - I really like horses, and I used to go horseback riding a lot.
 - I don't like seafood (but I used to!). Sushi and clam chowder are among the things I used to eat that I now won't touch. However, I love hibachi when chicken or cows are involved.
 - I play guitar and sing, but only for myself. I'd like to be a musician and play for a crowd of millions, but for now I'm content to make noise in the privacy of my apartment.
 - Every now and then I enjoy a cigar.
 - I don't talk much, but if you ask me questions I'll usually answer.
 - I like cats. I am currently owned by two cats.
 - I let my mind wander when my feet can't. It gets me in trouble.
 - When I was younger (3 or so) I got dared to lick a mushroom. I got violently ill and won't eat them to this day.
 - I've done a barrel roll in a Super Hornet.
 - I enjoy model cars. My favorite is a red 1995 Camaro. Just kidding there's no way I can have a favorite that's like asking what my favorite food is.

### Contact
There are several ways to contact me, but the quickest ways tend to be [Twitter](#twitter) and IRC. I'm "Amanda" on Freenode and "Perihelion" on OFTC. If you want to chat, please tell me who you are, what you're after, and the best way to contact you (if other than IRC/Twitter).

### Twitter

Aka my adventure in How to Make Friends and Tweet People.

Chances are that my Twitter bio brought you here. Hi! This is a segment about following me/how I use Twitter. Hopefully it'll shine some light on my shenanigans.

 - *Tweets are mine and mine alone.* This means you shouldn't take your frustration towards me out on anyone *but* me.
 - *I use Twitter for work and play.* This means you'll see some things about work, life, hobbies, and general happenings. If you're cool with that we can be friends. If you're not cool with that then we can be LinkedIn friends instead. Maybe.
 - *I tend to retweet my employer a lot.* Because of the nature of my work, I retweet my employer a lot to help spread the word. Since they pay me to do so, I'm just gonna go ahead and keep doing it.
 - *I livetweet events.* When I go to events, there's a high probability that I'll livetweet or retweet things others have said. This can get pretty noisy but usually only lasts a few hours. 
 - *I swear.* Sometimes it's a sprinkling of swear words and sometimes it's an avalanche. I've even been known to smash swear words together to make SUPER SWEAR WORDS. The point is, sometimes my tweets are wholesome and sometimes they're NSFW.
 - *I am sarcastic as f.* I try to make it clear when I'm being sarcastic but I don't always succeed. If I've said something and you're not sure whether to laugh or rage, ask.
 - *My mental age spans 5-45 years.* Physically I'm somewhere in between. That means toilet humor is sometimes tweeted.
 - *I don't always followback.* And it's nothing personal. Seriously! I follow my feed religiously so I try to follow less than 400 people. Ideally it would be 200. Not following everyone who follows me cuts down on SNR.
 - *I make Twitter lists.* Sometimes I add people to lists instead of following them. Lists are great because I can curate my feed a bit better and other people can follow the list if it's relevant to them. In a way, it's better than a followback.

So that's about it when it comes to Twitter. I try to reply to everyone who tweets at me but sometimes I fail. Don't let that stop you from saying hi sometime.
