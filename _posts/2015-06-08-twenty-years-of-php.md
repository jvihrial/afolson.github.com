I started with PHP 4. By many accounts I was late to the PHParty, but when you take into consideration that PHP4 releases happened in the early 2000s, I've been using PHP for over half of its life...and mine.

I owe a lot to PHP. PHP and I discovered the World Wide Web and stayed up late making Neopets clones (which I still have!) and IRC bots. PHP was there when I started my own company, and PHP is here as I prepare to launch a side project that I've invested myself into completely. To make a long story short, I owe a lot to PHP (and Rasmus Lerdorf), and it's why I'm committed to making the next 20 years kick ass.

Here's to the next 20!
